# TechKnowledge
A guide for the technical (non-coding) questions commonly asked during software engineering interviews

## OOPS Concepts
* **Overloading vs Overriding** : Overloading is the concept where 2 methods have the same name but different parameters. Overriding is the concept where 2 methods have the same name and the same parameters. (one method would be in parent class and the other in child class)

* **Virtual Functions** : A function declared in base class but defined in derived class (overriding), use a pointer/reference to base class to call the derived class's version. It must be declared in public. [Runtime Polymorphism]

* **Polymorphism** : The ability of an object to vary it's behaviour based on its type i.e. allows you to handle different data types/objects through the same interface. (Concept similar to overriding)

## C/C++ specific questions
* **Size of data types** : *char* - 1 byte, *int* - 2 bytes *float* - 4 bytes, *double* - 8 bytes

## Data Structures
* **Difference between ordered_map and map** :
* **Difference between ordered_set and set** :

## Databases
* **Database index** :
* **Data warehousing** :

## Operating Systems
* **Mutex** :  
* **Condition Variable** :
* **Threads vs Process** :
* **Memory hierachy** :


## Others
* **Microservices** :
